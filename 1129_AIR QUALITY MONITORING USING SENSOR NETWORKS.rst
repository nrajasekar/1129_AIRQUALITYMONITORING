1.	Name (Project heading) : AIR QUALITY MONITORING USING SENSOR NETWORKS

2.	Remote Centre ID (RC_ID) : 1129	

3.	College / Institute Name : VELLORE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY

4.	City, State, Pin Code : VELLORE, TAMILNADU - 632014

5.	Name/’s of the TEAM MEMBERS: Prof. RAGHUVEER V.R Team Members: MURALI.S

6.	About (Short Description / Summary): Extensive studies have been performed for monitoring air quality in order to determine the levels of harmful gases. The previous proposed systems are sometimes very large as a big system, therefore it is not easy to move to other locations, requires raw data from the case sites because another additional techniques are utilized to process this data and the technology is only available for laboratory experiments. Meanwhile, air pollution monitoring and control are totally required in order to maintain the air quality in the tolerable and expected limits. The  purpose  of  this  project  is  to  build  an   air  quality  monitoring  system which could measure the levels of gases and record them which could be accessed any time.

7.	Install (Installation procedure): Install the application, go to the home screen, select the appropriate sensor, fetch the data.

8.	Usage (add instruction on how to use the app, or you can redirect to External link if you have one):- Instruction to use the application is available in the document posted with this.
